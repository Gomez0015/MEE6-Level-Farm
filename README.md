# MEE6-Level-Farm
Farm MEE6 Levels like a boss.

This is a project to try and bypass MEE6 Leveling using Machine Learning we are far from perfectly achieving this, thats why the repo is public. If you would like to contribute to this long and har journey just make a pull request adding a new intent file using the format catergory.question.json (i.e greetings.hey.json), Also make sure the format matches the others and who know? We might add your work to the project! Together we can make a bot to never farm MEE6 Again!

# Configuration
After cloning the repository use `npm install`

Then head over to the `.env.example` file and change the Variables and change the name to : `.env`

Get User Token (token of your discord user can be found in network tab of chrome when on web discord in Authorization Header os XHR requests to the api):
![alt text](https://github.com/Gomez0015/MEE6-Level-Farm/blob/master/userToken.jpg?raw=true)

Then just run `node train.js` This will train the bot using the intents folder (you can upgrade the intents to make it smarter)

Finally run `node bot.js` 

Boom! Done!
